            <li>The information stored in the catalog is called meta -data.</li>
            <li>In traditional file processing, data definition is typically part of the application programs themselves</li>
            <li>Hence, these programs are constrained to work with only one specific database, whose structure is declared in the application programs</li>

            <li>A database typically has many users, each of whom may require a different perspective or view of the database.</li>
            <li>one user of the database may be interested only in accessing and printing the transcript of each student.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>A multiuser DBMS allow multiple users to access the database at the same time</li>
        <li>The DBMS must include concurrency control software to ensure that several users trying to update the same data do so in a controlled manner so that the result of the updates is correct. </li>
        <li>several reservation agents try to assign a seat on an airline flight, the DBMS should ensure that each seat can be accessed by only one agent at a time for assignment to a passenger. </li>

    <ul>
        <li>For example, when several reservation agents try to assign a seat on an airline flight, the DBMS should ensure that each seat can be accessed by only one agent at a time for assignment to a passenger. These types of applications are generally called online transaction processing (OLTP) applications.</li>
        <li>A fundamental role of multiuser DBMS software is to ensure that concurrent transactions operate correctly and efficiently.</li>
